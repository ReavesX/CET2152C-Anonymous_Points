For each course points the program should ask for the number of points for the course and the minimum number of points allowed in the course. For the enrolled columnn write a logic statement that checks for the minimum number, if the enrolled is larger than the minimum number, display input max points, if the enrolled is smaller than the minimum number display multiply min by two. The course points are the result fo the min number and enrolled. The total course points is all the course points added together and added to the extra points (added by the user)  minus the base points which is also added by the user.
